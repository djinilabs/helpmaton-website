Have you ever wanted to build your own AI agent? Maybe you've imagined a personal assistant that remembers your preferences, a research bot that monitors topics you care about, or an automation workflow that handles repetitive tasks while you focus on what matters. If you're a hobbyist, enthusiast, or just curious about what's possible with AI agents, Helpmaton might be what you're looking for.

## What is Helpmaton?

Helpmaton is a platform for creating, deploying, and improving AI agents. Whether you want a simple chat assistant or an automation system that works in the background, it gives you the tools to build it without getting lost in infrastructure complexity.

Think of Helpmaton as a workspace for your AI agents. You organize agents into dedicated workspaces, each with its own settings, team members, and access controls. Within each workspace, you can create multiple agents, each with a specific role and purpose. What's nice is that these agents don't just chat—they can perform work autonomously, communicate with you through external channels when needed, and even be embedded directly into your products.

## Getting Started: Your First Agent 🚀

Getting started with Helpmaton is pretty straightforward. You don't need to be an AI expert or have a background in machine learning. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a workspace** – Organize your agents by project or purpose
2. **Build your first agent** – Give it a name, role, and clear instructions
3. **Start chatting** – Test it out right away in the web interface
4. **Connect it to the world** – Add integrations, tools, or webhooks as needed

You can have a working agent pretty quickly. The platform handles the infrastructure, API management, and deployment stuff so you can focus on what your agent should do, not how to make it work.

## Beyond Chat: Agents That Actually Work

While chat interfaces are nice, Helpmaton agents can do more than just have conversations. They can:

### Work in the Background ⏰

Agents can run on schedules using cron-based prompts. For example, you might have a research agent that checks for new articles about your interests every morning and sends you a summary. Or a monitoring agent that watches your systems and alerts you only when something needs attention. These agents work on their own, handling tasks without requiring your constant attention.

### Communicate on External Channels 💬

Your agents don't have to live only in Helpmaton's interface. They can communicate with you and your team through:

- **Slack** – Deploy agents as Slack bots that respond to mentions and direct messages
- **Discord** – Create community bots with slash commands for your servers
- **Email** – Send notifications and updates via email when important events occur
- **Webhooks** – Every agent exposes webhook endpoints, so you can integrate them into any system

This means your agents can be where your team already works, which makes them more useful than another tool you have to remember to check.

### Perform Complex Automation ⚙️

Agents can coordinate workflows, make decisions, and handle multi-step processes. With built-in tools and integrations, they can:

- Search and manage documents in your knowledge base
- Look up current information on the web
- Connect to Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) in a few clicks
- Integrate with Notion to read and update pages
- Send notifications to Slack or Discord channels
- Delegate tasks to other agents in the same workspace

So it's not just about answering questions—it's about agents that can actually do work for you.

## Improving Your Agents: Evals, Knowledge, and Tools

Once you have a basic agent working, there are several ways to make it better:

### Judge Evals: Check Quality ✅

How do you know if your agent is actually good? Judge evaluations let you score conversations, validate behavior, and catch regressions with just a couple of clicks. After you make changes to prompts or instructions, run evals to make sure quality hasn't slipped. Sampling controls help you balance insight and cost, while analytics track results over time.

### Knowledge Bases: Give Agents Context 📚

Upload Markdown and text documents to build knowledge bases your agents can search and use. This works well for:

- FAQ content that keeps answers consistent
- Brand guidelines for content-writing agents
- Technical documentation for support agents
- Research sources for analysis agents

Agents can search these documents automatically, so they have the right context to give accurate, helpful responses.

### Memory: Agents That Remember 🧠

Agents remember key details from your conversations and use them to give better, more personal answers over time. You can customize how memory works—set summary preferences per agent and choose time grains (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly). Your agents get smarter the more you use them, without you having to repeat information.

### Built-in Tools and Custom Integrations

Every agent comes with built-in tools like document search, memory access, web search, email, and notifications. When you need more, you can add custom tools and integrations. The platform supports webhooks, API connections, and direct integrations with popular services.

## Embedding Agents in Your Products 🔌

You can embed chat-based agents directly into your products. Every agent exposes webhook endpoints, and responses can be streamed token-by-token (SSE) for real-time chat experiences. This means you can:

- Add AI-powered support to your website
- Create assistants in your applications
- Build custom chat interfaces that connect to your agents
- Provide real-time, streaming responses

The webhook API makes integration straightforward, whether you're building a simple chat widget or a more complex application that needs AI capabilities.

## Real-World Examples

Here are a few ways people use Helpmaton:

**Personal Research Assistant** – An agent that monitors news and articles about topics you care about, summarizes them daily, and sends updates to your Discord server.

**Customer Support Bot** – A Slack bot that answers common questions using your knowledge base, handles basic troubleshooting, and escalates complex issues to your team.

**Workflow Automator** – An agent that monitors your systems, processes incoming requests, coordinates with other agents, and sends notifications when work is complete—all running on a schedule in the background.

**Product Integration** – A chat agent embedded in your SaaS product that helps users understand features, troubleshoot issues, and find documentation—all powered by your knowledge base.

## Cost Control and Flexibility 💰

Cost matters, especially for hobbyists and enthusiasts. You can:

- Set agent-specific spending limits (daily, monthly, or yearly)
- Buy credits or use your own API key (currently via OpenRouter)
- Track usage by day, workspace, or agent
- Keep an eye on costs with clear analytics

This gives you control over spending while still having the flexibility to scale when needed.

## Source-Available and Self-Hostable 📦

Helpmaton is source-available under the Business Source License 1.1, converting to Apache 2.0 on 2029-11-01. This means you can self-host it when you need to, giving you control over your agents and data.
