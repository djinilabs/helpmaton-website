Have you ever wanted to build your own AI agent? Maybe you've imagined a personal assistant that remembers your preferences, a research bot that monitors topics you care about, or an automation workflow that handles repetitive tasks while you focus on what matters. Whether you're experimenting with AI, building production systems, or somewhere in between, Helpmaton provides a platform to test, deploy, and improve your agents.

## What is Helpmaton?

Helpmaton is a platform for creating, deploying, and improving AI agents. Whether you want a simple chat assistant or an automation system that works in the background, it gives you the tools to build it without getting lost in infrastructure complexity.

Think of Helpmaton as a workspace for your AI agents. You organize agents into dedicated workspaces, each with its own settings, team members, and access controls. Within each workspace, you can create multiple agents, each with a specific role and purpose. What's nice is that these agents don't just chat—they can perform work autonomously, communicate with you through external channels when needed, and even be embedded directly into your products.

## Provider-Agnostic: Use Any AI Model You Want 🎯

One of Helpmaton's key features is that it's completely provider-agnostic. You're not locked into a single AI provider—you can use any model from any provider you prefer. Whether you want to use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any other provider, Helpmaton gives you the flexibility to choose what works best for your use case and budget.

This means you can:
- **Compare models** – Test different providers and models to see which works best for your agents
- **Optimize costs** – Use different providers for different agents based on cost and performance needs
- **Avoid vendor lock-in** – Switch providers or models whenever you need to, without rebuilding your agents
- **Use your own API keys** – Bring your own keys from any provider (currently via OpenRouter)

Your agents work the same way regardless of which provider you choose, so you can focus on building great agents rather than managing provider-specific integrations.

## Getting Started: Build, Test, and Deploy 🚀

Getting started with Helpmaton is straightforward. You don't need to be an AI expert or manage complex infrastructure. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a workspace** – Organize your agents by project or purpose
2. **Build your first agent** – Give it a name, role, and clear instructions
3. **Test it out** – Chat with it right away in the web interface, iterate on prompts, and refine behavior
4. **Deploy it** – Connect integrations, tools, or webhooks to put it to work

You can have a working agent quickly, test different approaches, and deploy when you're ready. The platform handles the infrastructure, API management, and deployment complexity so you can focus on what your agent should do, not how to make it work.

## Beyond Chat: Agents That Actually Work

While chat interfaces are nice, Helpmaton agents can do more than just have conversations. They can:

### Work in the Background ⏰

Agents can run on schedules using cron-based prompts. For example, you might have a research agent that checks for new articles about your interests every morning and sends you a summary. Or a monitoring agent that watches your systems and alerts you only when something needs attention. These agents work on their own, handling tasks without requiring your constant attention.

### Communicate on External Channels 💬

Your agents don't have to live only in Helpmaton's interface. They can communicate with you and your team through:

- **Slack** – Deploy agents as Slack bots that respond to mentions and direct messages
- **Discord** – Create community bots with slash commands for your servers
- **Email** – Send notifications and updates via email when important events occur
- **Webhooks** – Every agent exposes webhook endpoints, so you can integrate them into any system

This means your agents can be where your team already works, which makes them more useful than another tool you have to remember to check.

### Perform Complex Automation ⚙️

Agents can coordinate workflows, make decisions, and handle multi-step processes. With built-in tools and integrations, they can:

- Search and manage documents in your knowledge base
- Look up current information on the web
- Connect to Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) in a few clicks
- Integrate with Notion to read and update pages
- Send notifications to Slack or Discord channels
- Delegate tasks to other agents in the same workspace

So it's not just about answering questions—it's about agents that can actually do work for you.

## Testing and Iterating: Make Your Agents Better

Helpmaton is built for testing and iteration. Once you have a basic agent working, you can test changes, measure quality, and deploy with confidence:

### Judge Evals: Test Quality Before Deploying ✅

How do you know if your agent is actually good? Judge evaluations let you score conversations, validate behavior, and catch regressions with just a couple of clicks. Test different prompts, compare results, and make sure quality hasn't slipped before deploying changes. Sampling controls help you balance insight and cost, while analytics track results over time. This makes it easy to iterate safely and deploy with confidence.

### Knowledge Bases: Give Agents Context 📚

Upload Markdown and text documents to build knowledge bases your agents can search and use. This works well for:

- FAQ content that keeps answers consistent
- Brand guidelines for content-writing agents
- Technical documentation for support agents
- Research sources for analysis agents

Agents can search these documents automatically, so they have the right context to give accurate, helpful responses.

### Memory: Agents That Remember 🧠

Agents remember key details from your conversations and use them to give better, more personal answers over time. You can customize how memory works—set summary preferences per agent and choose time grains (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly). Your agents get smarter the more you use them, without you having to repeat information.

### Built-in Tools and Custom Integrations

Every agent comes with built-in tools like document search, memory access, web search, email, and notifications. When you need more, you can add custom tools and integrations. The platform supports webhooks, API connections, and direct integrations with popular services.

## Deploying Agents: From Testing to Production 🔌

Helpmaton makes it easy to move from testing to deployment. Every agent exposes webhook endpoints, and responses can be streamed token-by-token (SSE) for real-time chat experiences. You can:

- **Test in the web interface** – Iterate on prompts and behavior before deploying
- **Deploy via webhooks** – Integrate agents into any system or application
- **Embed in products** – Add AI-powered support to your website or application
- **Connect to external channels** – Deploy to Slack, Discord, or other platforms
- **Stream responses** – Provide real-time, streaming responses for better UX

The webhook API makes integration straightforward, whether you're building a simple chat widget or a complex application. Test your agents thoroughly, then deploy them where they're needed.

## Real-World Examples

Here are a few ways people use Helpmaton:

**Personal Research Assistant** – An agent that monitors news and articles about topics you care about, summarizes them daily, and sends updates to your Discord server.

**Customer Support Bot** – A Slack bot that answers common questions using your knowledge base, handles basic troubleshooting, and escalates complex issues to your team.

## Cost Control and Flexibility 💰

Cost control matters whether you're experimenting or running production systems. Since Helpmaton is provider-agnostic, you have even more flexibility:

- **Use any provider** – Choose the provider and model that fits your budget
- **Set agent-specific spending limits** – Daily, monthly, or yearly caps per agent
- **Bring your own keys** – Use your own API keys from any provider (currently via OpenRouter)
- **Track usage** – See usage by day, workspace, or agent with clear analytics
- **Compare costs** – Test different providers to find the best price-to-performance ratio

This gives you control over spending while still having the flexibility to scale when needed. Perfect for testing different approaches and providers without worrying about unexpected costs.

## Source-Available and Self-Hostable 📦

Helpmaton is source-available under the Business Source License 1.1, converting to Apache 2.0 on 2029-11-01. This means you can self-host it when you need to, giving you control over your agents and data.
